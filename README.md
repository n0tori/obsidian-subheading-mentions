# obsidian-subheading-mentions
An Obsidian plugin that scans the vault for "Unlinked mentions" that include subheadings as well as note titles.

code written with Claude.
1. Linking outgoing links within the note itself doesn't work.
2. Quite good at searching for backlinks and displaying all of the subheading matches from other notes in the vault.
